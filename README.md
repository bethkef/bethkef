Hi, Iâ€™m Felix S. Bethke

I am a researcher at the [Peace Research Institute Frankfurt](https://www.hsfk.de/en/), Germany working on democratization, protests, and African politics.
On github, I am mostly interested in learning new skills for data collection and data management, especially record linkage and Wikidata.
